    <h1>US State Laws Regulating Genetic Discrimination in Law Enforcement</h1>
    <p class="subheading">State Comparisons of Protective Features</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <h3 style="color:#000000; text-align: left;">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Since 2018, lawmakers, law enforcement, defense counsel, and others have debated whether and how law enforcement should be able to tap consumer genetics platforms for investigative purposes. Forensic Investigative Genetic Genealogy (“FIGG”) involves comparing crime scene DNA data to DNA profiles held by consumer genetic platforms to find individuals distantly related to a possible perpetrator. By compiling extensive family trees, investigators hope to identify the individual within the family tree most likely to be the source of the crime scene evidence. FIGG burst into public view with the arrest of the Golden State Killer, and law enforcement throughout the country have since used this method to identify suspects in nearly a thousand cases. As use of FIGG has expanded, so too have the types of cases in which this method has been pursued.
    </p><br>
    <p>While many states do not have relevant laws on the books, some states have begun to engage in efforts to regulate and formalize law enforcement use of FIGG. Most notably, Maryland and Utah have enacted comprehensive regulatory frameworks governing this investigative method. As other legislators consider regulation in this space, they should be mindful of several features that can make legislation more or less protective of genetic privacy, while still authorizing appropriate law enforcement use. Seven protective features are set out below.</p>
    <br>

    <h3 style="color:#000000; text-align: left;">1. Regulate law enforcement directly</h3>
    <p>
      Several states have enacted legislation intended to protect privacy for users of consumer genetics platforms. Most of these laws direct consumer genetics platforms to provide clear notice of their privacy practices that are written in plain language, obtain express consent from consumers for using and disclosing genetic data, and establish legal policies for non-consensual data disclosure to law enforcement. But a handful of states regulate law enforcement directly, for instance by requiring law enforcement to seek familial matches only through platforms that obtain user consent to law enforcement use.

          (a) To safeguard the privacy, confidentiality, security, and integrity of a consumer's genetic data, <strong>a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company shall</strong> do both of the following:<br>
          Provide clear and complete information regarding the company's policies and procedures for the collection, use, maintenance, and disclosure, as applicable, of genetic data<br>
          Obtain a consumer's express consent for collection, use, and disclosure of the consumer's genetic data . . . <br><br>

          (b) only make a request to a genetic genealogy company that:<br>
          (i) provides notice to the genetic genealogy company's service users and the public that law enforcement may use the genetic genealogy company's services to investigate crimes or to identify unidentified human remains . . . <br><br>
          Utah Code § 53-10-403.7 (emphasis added)
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      These provisions appear to have the same goal—restricting law enforcement to platforms and users who have given consent—but they may have very different results. After all, in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/idaho-murders-bryan-kohberger-dna.html">several</a> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/minnesota/supreme-court/2024/a22-1679.html">cases</a> already litigated, investigators have sought familial matches in databases that do not permit law enforcement use or without disclosing their law enforcement status so as to seek matches even among users who have declined law enforcement use. Regulating platforms is unlikely to deter zealous law enforcement investigators. Regulating law enforcement directly, however, minimizes the risk of such deceptive behavior by making it unlawful.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3 style="color:#000000; text-align: left;">2. Include a Role for Judicial Oversight</h3>
    <p>
      Whether law enforcement must obtain judicial authorization before engaging in FIGG can reinforce accountability for compliance with statutory privacy protections. Judicial oversight introduces a neutral third-party decisionmaker outside of law enforcement, enhancing trust in the system and promoting good policymaking by balancing investigative needs with individual rights. States have incorporated judicial oversight in different ways.<br><br>
      States that regulate law enforcement conduct directly have taken divergent approaches to judicial oversight at the initiation of a FIGG search. Montana requires either user consent or a warrant for some searches, while implying that a warrant is always required for FIGG. Maryland requires judicial authorization of law enforcement's use of FIGG in every case and specifies the kinds of cases for which authorization is permitted. This authorization is distinct from the general standards for subpoenas or warrants. Finally, Utah does not require any judicial oversight before law enforcement undertakes FIGG.

    <p>Among states with statutes that regulate consumer genetics platforms (rather than law enforcement directly), the language surrounding legal process and court orders can be confusing. Some states prohibit platforms from disclosing user genetic data without the user's consent unless served with a court order or warrant. Others merely require some form of “valid legal process” for such disclosures, which leaves room for misunderstanding and could include subpoenas issued without a court's review or involvement. Even more confusingly, some states require “a valid legal process,” which might include processes internal to the consumer genetics platform itself.</p>

    <p>Finally, though Utah does not provide for judicial oversight of law enforcement's use of FIGG, it does require judicial involvement if a convicted person seeks to use FIGG to prove their innocence. Maryland requires judicial oversight in both instances, as well as for cases in which a criminal defendant (for yet convicted) seeks to use FIGG in their defense. In other states, defense or postconviction access to FIGG is unaddressed, leaving the power of this method unfairly only for the prosecution in most instances.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#000000; text-align: left;">3. Affirm individual control over investigative use of genetic data</h3>
    <p>
      Nearly all states that have enacted legislation relevant to consumer genetic privacy recognize the important role of an individual's control over use of their genetic data. Some states limit law enforcement use to those platforms that obtain affirmative consent from users for law enforcement matching. This kind of explicit consent is crucial for good policymaking because it ensures that users make a knowing and voluntary choice to participate in law enforcement efforts.

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Both Maryland and Utah's policies expressly limit law enforcement use only to those platforms that seek and obtain consent from users for that type of use. Maryland's requirement that platforms obtain “express consent” from users may go further than Utah's requirement that users be able to “opt in or out” of law enforcement use. Utah's formulation may allow law enforcement use of consumer genetics platforms that opt users into such use by default, while Maryland's policy requires affirmative, opt in consent. Importantly, however, Utah's policy specifies that users' power to opt out of law enforcement searches be genuine. That is, Utah mandates that users must be able to opt out of law enforcement use without having to give up access to the platform as a whole. This is significant, as tying consent to law enforcement use to consent to use the platform at all undermines users' free and voluntary choices regarding law enforcement use.</p><br>
    <p>But most states, while purporting to “safeguard the privacy, confidentiality, security, and integrity of a consumer's genetic data,” permit law enforcement to get around a user's lack of consent by using some alternate process. These provisions often use confusing, and confusingly similar, terms for a range of possible legal pathways.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#000000; text-align: left;">4. 4.	Protect third parties who are not suspects in the crime</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes, law enforcement investigators working on FIGG may find themselves stumped due to gaps in the genealogical family tree they are constructing. In those circumstances, investigators may want to collect DNA from people who aren't suspected of a crime but who might be related to a possible suspect. Those DNA profiles can help fill in and complete a family tree, helping to identify a possible criminal perpetrator. What rules should govern how law enforcement goes about obtaining those DNA samples? After all, the individuals whom investigators want to test are not suspected of any crime. 
    </p><br>
    <p>Most state statutes about consumer genetics platforms do not address these significant questions. Maryland and Utah, however, have addressed this issue as part of their comprehensive regulatory statutes on FIGG.</p>

    <p>Both Maryland and Utah establish informed consent from non-suspect third parties as the typical route that law enforcement must take for obtaining DNA from these individuals. Both states also provide a process for obtaining these DNA samples without the third party's knowledge (or consent). In Maryland, covert DNA collections must be approved by a judge, and the statute does not permit covert DNA collections where a non-suspect third party was previously asked for consent and refused to give it, or where investigators don't want to ask for consent because they think it may be refused. In Utah, investigators must consult with prosecutors before approaching any third party for DNA collection. This goes further than Maryland's law, by requiring consultation with prosecutors even for DNA collections with the consent of the third party tested. Covert collections in Utah, however, do not require judicial oversight and the basis for using covert methods is easier to meet. On the whole, by regulating DNA collections from non-suspect third parties, both Maryland and Utah do more than other states to honor privacy rights, promote transparency, and address the evolving implications of genetic science.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color:#000000; text-align: left;">5. Make FIGG available to prove innocence, not just guilt</h3>
    <p>Promoting justice requires that criminal defendants have fair access to FIGG, which typically requires legislation. Defense and postconviction counsel may have trouble accessing crime scene evidence for testing, since that evidence is usually held by law enforcement who may not be eager to cooperate. Moreover, defense and postconviction counsel are generally at a disadvantage in negotiating with platforms for access, particularly as many platforms limit access in their terms of service to “law enforcement” specifically.</p>
      <br>
    <p>Unfortunately, like platform terms to service, most states neglect this important issue in their Genetic Information Privacy Acts. These statutes typically require consent or some other legal process before users' genetic data is shared with “law enforcement or any other government agency.” But this leaves defense-side access on unequal footing, compared with the prosecution.</p><br>
    <p>Here again, Maryland and Utah stand apart from other states. Each has enacted a statute that safeguards FIGG for defense and /or postconviction use. Both states require judicial approval for this use. Maryland's statute sets out terms for defense and postconviction use that are equivalent to those governing law enforcement.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#000000; text-align: left;">6. Impose genuine consequences for violations</h3>
    <p>Consequences for violations of public policy are essential to ensure accountability and deter misconduct. Accountability, in turn, helps maintain trust in public institutions and promotes fairness and justice. But consequences that are minor or unlikely to be enforced, however, may have the opposite effect, undermining public trust and eroding confidence in the rule of law.</p><br>
    <p>States have taken a variety of approaches in codifying consequences for violating consumer genetic privacy, with some more likely to prompt rule following than others. Some states authorize individuals to sue if their rights to genetic privacy are violated. A larger group of states have instead opted to permit the state attorney general or other public official to sue, rather than authorizing consumers to sue. Although it may appear wise to channel litigation through a state office to make sure that suits are not frivolous, in practice, the many demands on attorneys general may yield underenforcement or non-enforcement even of clear violations. This is particularly so in cases where the defendant's alleged misconduct consisted of cooperating with law enforcement. Wyoming, for its part, provides for suits both by injured individuals and by the state attorney general. Utah, meanwhile, appears to contemplate civil suits, but does not specify who may bring them. Utah's enforcement scheme is further undermined by the limited remedy it offers for wrongdoing: barring the individual who violated the law from participating in FIGG searches for one year. The statute expressly rules out money damages as a remedy.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#000000; text-align: left;">7. Require public reporting and review</h3>
    <p>
      Public reporting and review are vital for good policymaking because they ensure transparency and accountability. This transparency allows legislators and the public to understand how consumer genetic information is used in law enforcement efforts. Yet few statutes today contemplate public reporting. Laws that regulate law enforcement directly top the list of those mandating public information about law enforcement use of consumer genetics platforms.

    <p>State statutes regulating consumer genetics platforms do not require these platforms to disclose how many times they permitted law enforcement to conduct FIGG searches each year, though some platforms have <a href="https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FPF_Consumer_Genetic_Testing_Companies_Report_v4.3.pdf">voluntarily undertaken</a> such efforts. State statutes regulating law enforcement's interaction with consumer genetics platforms, by contrast, are more likely to require public reporting of relevant law enforcement data. This is the case for both Maryland and Utah, which each require relevant law enforcement entities to report to a central government body the number of FIGG searches undertaken each year, as well as key details about the kinds of cases in which FIGG was pursued. Importantly, both states require the resulting state-wide report to be made publicly available. Maryland goes further still, calling for an interdisciplinary body to review the report each year and make policy recommendations as appropriate.</p>
