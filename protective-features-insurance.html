         <!-- Overview -->
         <h3 style="color:#000000;">Overview</h3>
         <p>
            Since 2018, lawmakers, law enforcement, defense counsel, and others have debated whether and how law enforcement should be able to tap consumer genetics platforms for investigative purposes. Forensic Investigative Genetic Genealogy (“FIGG”) involves comparing crime scene DNA data to DNA profiles held by consumer genetic platforms to find individuals distantly related to a possible perpetrator. By compiling extensive family trees, investigators hope to identify the individual within the family tree most likely to be the source of the crime scene evidence. FIGG burst into public view with the arrest of the Golden State Killer, and law enforcement throughout the country have since used this method to identify suspects in nearly a thousand cases. As use of FIGG has expanded, so too have the types of cases in which this method has been pursued.
         </p>
         <p>
            While many states do not have relevant laws on the books, some states have begun to engage in efforts to regulate and formalize law enforcement use of FIGG. Most notably, Maryland and Utah have enacted comprehensive regulatory frameworks governing this investigative method. As other legislators consider regulation in this space, they should be mindful of several features that can make legislation more or less protective of genetic privacy, while still authorizing appropriate law enforcement use. Seven protective features are set out below.
         </p>
         <h3 style="color:#000000;">1. Regulate law enforcement directly</h3>
         <p>
            Several states have enacted legislation intended to protect privacy for users of consumer genetics platforms. Most of these laws direct consumer genetics platforms to provide clear notice of their privacy practices that are written in plain language, obtain express consent from consumers for using and disclosing genetic data, and establish legal policies for non-consensual data disclosure to law enforcement. But a handful of states regulate law enforcement directly, for instance by requiring law enforcement to seek familial matches only through platforms that obtain user consent to law enforcement use.

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;(a) disclose to the genetic genealogy company that the request is from a law enforcement agency;<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;(b) only make a request to a genetic genealogy company that:<br>

            </tr>
         </table>
         <p>
            These provisions appear to have the same goal—restricting law enforcement to platforms and users who have given consent—but they may have very different results. After all, in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/idaho-murders-bryan-kohberger-dna.html" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/minnesota/supreme-court/2024/a22-1679.html" target="_blank">cases</a> already litigated, investigators have sought familial matches in databases that do not permit law enforcement use or without disclosing their law enforcement status so as to seek matches even among users who have declined law enforcement use. Regulating platforms is unlikely to deter zealous law enforcement investigators. Regulating law enforcement directly, however, minimizes the risk of such deceptive behavior by making it unlawful.
         </p>
         <h3 style="color:#000000;">2. Include a Role for Judicial Oversight</h3>
         <p>
            Whether law enforcement must obtain judicial authorization before engaging in FIGG can reinforce accountability for compliance with statutory privacy protections. Judicial oversight introduces a neutral third-party decisionmaker outside of law enforcement, enhancing trust in the system and promoting good policymaking by balancing investigative needs with individual rights. States have incorporated judicial oversight in different ways.
         </p>
         <p>
            States that regulate law enforcement conduct directly have taken divergent approaches to judicial oversight at the initiation of a FIGG search. Montana requires either user consent or a warrant for some searches, while implying that a warrant is always required for FIGG. Maryland requires judicial authorization of law enforcement’s use of FIGG in every case and specifies the kinds of cases for which authorization is permitted. This authorization is distinct from the general standards for subpoenas or warrants. Finally, Utah does not require any judicial oversight before law enforcement undertakes FIGG.

         <p>Among states with statutes that regulate consumer genetics platforms (rather than law enforcement directly), the language surrounding legal process and court orders can be confusing. Some states prohibit platforms from disclosing user genetic data without the user’s consent unless served with a court order or warrant. Others merely require some form of “valid legal process” for such disclosures, which leaves room for misunderstanding and could include subpoenas issued without a court’s review or involvement. Even more confusingly, some states require “a valid legal process,” which might include processes internal to the consumer genetics platform itself.</p>

         <p>Finally, though Utah does not provide for judicial oversight of law enforcement’s use of FIGG, it does require judicial involvement if a convicted person seeks to use FIGG to prove their innocence. Maryland requires judicial oversight in both instances, as well as for cases in which a criminal defendant (for yet convicted) seeks to use FIGG in their defense. In other states, defense or postconviction access to FIGG is unaddressed, leaving the power of this method unfairly only for the prosecution in most instances.</p>

            Nearly all states that have enacted legislation relevant to consumer genetic privacy recognize the important role of an individual’s control over use of their genetic data. Some states limit law enforcement use to those platforms that obtain affirmative consent from users for law enforcement matching. This kind of explicit consent is crucial for good policymaking because it ensures that users make a knowing and voluntary choice to participate in law enforcement efforts.

         <p>
          Both Maryland and Utah’s policies expressly limit law enforcement use only to those platforms that seek and obtain consent from users for that type of use. Maryland’s requirement that platforms obtain “express consent” from users may go further than Utah’s requirement that users be able to “opt in or out” of law enforcement use. Utah’s formulation may allow law enforcement use of consumer genetics platforms that opt users into such use by default, while Maryland’s policy requires affirmative, opt in consent. Importantly, however, Utah’s policy specifies that users’ power to opt out of law enforcement searches be genuine. That is, Utah mandates that users must be able to opt out of law enforcement use without having to give up access to the platform as a whole. This is significant, as tying consent to law enforcement use to consent to use the platform at all undermines users’ free and voluntary choices regarding law enforcement use.

          But most states, while purporting to “safeguard the privacy, confidentiality, security, and integrity of a consumer's genetic data,” permit law enforcement to get around a user’s lack of consent by using some alternate process. These provisions often use confusing, and confusingly similar, terms for a range of possible legal pathways.

         <p>
            In FIGG investigations, gaps in a genealogical family tree may prompt law enforcement to collect DNA from individuals who are not themselves suspects but who may be related to a potential perpetrator. These rules govern how such third-party samples are obtained.

         <p>
            Fair access to FIGG is essential for criminal defendants. Defense and postconviction counsel often encounter obstacles when trying to obtain crime scene evidence for testing because such evidence is typically controlled by law enforcement—which may be reluctant to cooperate—creating an imbalance that disadvantages defendants.

         <p>
            Enforcing real consequences for breaches of consumer genetic privacy is critical for accountability and deterring misconduct. Some states allow individuals to sue for violations, while others empower state officials to enforce the law. Minor or unenforceable penalties, however, may not sufficiently deter wrongdoing.

            Public reporting and review are vital for transparency and accountability. Such reporting enables legislators and the public to understand how consumer genetic information is used in FIGG investigations. Yet few statutes require this level of transparency.
